//this is going to be the code that organizing all of our functions
//we will import all of our functions from our ./game folder

//im thinking we have seperate files for player, enemy, battle logic

//import player from './game/player'
//import enemy from './game/enemy'
//import battle-logic from './game/battle-logic'

function game() {
    //will check if there is a save state and load it
    //game starts and ends here
}
